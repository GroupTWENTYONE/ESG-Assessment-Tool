As the \npandemic crisis unfolded, it tested our \nphysical and mental resilience as individuals \nand as communities while changing the way \nwe live. It also burnished a bright light on  \nthe best of humanity as we saw thousands \nof individuals\u2014healthcare specialists, \ncommunity workers, essential services  \npersonnel\u2014put their personal health and \nsafety at risk while helping millions cope  \nwith the pandemic.\nThe world will never be the same again, and \nas we hit the reset button and reimagine our \nfuture, it\u2019s important to remember that  \nthe pandemic and its associated impact \non the economy has intensified existing \nvulnerabilities and created new ones. No one  \nknows when the crisis will end. What we do \nknow is that we are facing a new reality, and \nto thrive in it, we need a new way of thinking \nthat\u2019s inclusive and leaves no one behind. \nEmerging technologies can drive  \nsocio-economic recovery and enable a \nstep change in innovation-led growth. \nBesides driving business growth, advanced \ntechnologies like AI, IoT, big data analytics, \nextended reality and robotic process \nautomation help drive equitable growth \nthrough improved access to work \nopportunities, universal healthcare and \neducation for all. And as we embark on this \ndigitally powered growth journey, we need to \nconsider the potential and unintended risks. Chairperson\u2019s \nmessage\nFor example, millions of children have been \nimpacted by school closures and the lack of \ndigital learning infrastructure. While some \nhave been able to study remotely, many \nmore have been left out due to the lack of \naccess, or funds. We need to make the right \ninvestments today to mitigate these risks  \nfor the future.\nAt Accenture we recognize that now,  \nmore than ever, collaborating at scale,  \nand creating shared successes will be key  \nto reimagining the future and delivering  \non our priorities. We have a renewed \ncommitment to combining the promise of \ntechnology and human ingenuity to drive \n360\u00b0 value for not just our clients, our \npeople, shareholders and partners but also \nfor our communities, transforming not just \nour own industry and ecosystem but also \nultimately making a real difference in society. \nOur people have embraced constant change, \nremaining committed to creating lasting \nvalue, and we are incredibly proud of the \nwork we have done.\nI would like to thank our people and partners \nfor their ongoing support and collaboration, \nand for their extraordinary effort over \nthe past few months to making a positive \ndifference, every day. \nRekha M. Menon \nChairperson and Senior Managing Director \nAccenture in India",

Solely focused on complementing their  \non-the-ground efforts, we were able to \nswiftly repurpose our budgets to maximize \nthe overall impact. To ensure that our \npartners get back to their core strength \nof skilling youth, we helped them to pivot \ntoward digitizing content and virtualizing \ntraining delivery. We have released a series \nof playbooks to help partners recover and \noperate efficiently and virtually. We also \nhelped the NGO partners work closely with \nthe community members by: \n\u2022 Spreading awareness about the pandemic\n\u2022 Creating awareness about  \nhygiene standards \n\u2022 Facilitating disinfection activities \n\u2022 Training farmers on safety protocols   \n\u2022 Enabling women micro-entrepreneurs  \nstitch masks\n\u2022 Setting up a dedicated helpline for \npersons with disabilities to learn about  \nthe pandemic\n\u2022 Distributing 3D-printed face shields  \nto police personnel in West Bengal\nSupporting healthcare  \nworkers to help patients  \nand vulnerable individuals\nWe are working with both Oxfam India \nand Charities Aid Foundation to empower \nCOVID-19 frontline workers. Leveraging our \ndigital capabilities, we are helping Oxfam \ntrain community workers on the disease,  \nhow to prevent it and hygiene practices. \nThese workers are then educating the \ncommunities in which they work and live. \nThe organization has also been arranging \nawareness sessions through mobile vans as \nwell as through local media. So far, Oxfam has touched the lives of more \nthan 170,000 people through personal \nprotection kits and training, including digital \ntraining sessions via video conferencing. \nWorking with Oxfam and Charities Aid \nFoundation, we also provide personal \nprotection kits to doctors, nurses and \nsanitation workers. Each kit contains masks \nand face shields, protective suits, gloves and \nhand sanitizers. They have been distributed \nin hospitals and other places in the states \nof Karnataka, Kerala Maharashtra and Uttar \nPradesh as well as the National Capital \nRegion, including Gurgaon and Delhi. \nEmpowering the underprivileged \nto continue learning\nMany disadvantaged young people in India \nattend vocational training centers that use \nblended learning methods. With COVID-19 \nrestrictions in place, most can no longer \nattend these courses physically. Accenture \nand Quest Alliance developed an app that \noffers more than 150 free digital lessons so \nthat the underprivileged youth can continue \nbuilding their career and life skills virtually.\nSince the lockdown, more than 65,000 \nyouth have benefited from using Quest App, \nwhich provides lessons in communicative \nEnglish and digital literacy. The app also \nequips them with the skills they need for \nthe job market. This includes helping them \ncraft resumes, prepare for job interviews, \nunderstand the importance of teamwork, \nhandle workplace harassment and interact \nwith customers. Available in several Indian \nlanguages, the content is aligned with \nthe employability skills curriculum for \ngovernment-run vocational training centers.",

Being an expert in making a variety \nof jute products, it was easy for her to make \nface masks. Each day, after completing  \nher household tasks, she stitches 250  masks. Maheshwari has been assured of \ncontinuous business until January 2021,  \nand she is extremely happy. Her motto? \nPatience pays off!\nLakshmi and Maheshwari are just two  \nof 60 women skillpreneurs who have been \nchosen by the Tamil Nadu government  \nto manufacture one lakh masks.
