We believe that a world full of people with the opportunity to reach their full potential, who are more creative, means the world as a whole will be more creative. That is a future that excites all of us at Adobe. We are especially excited about our Creative Residents program, funded by Adobe Foundation and done in collaboration with world-class museums. In 2023 we identified four talented, engaging artists to be our first cohort of \nCreative Residents . \nThe imp\nact of Adobe\u2019s Creative Residents program goes far beyond \ngiving artists early in their careers access to resources at world-class museums. Each of the residents was selected in part because of their commitment and passion to work with local communities and mentor young artists, thereby inspiring the next generation to bring their creativity to life. Through collaboration with amazing artists and great museums we hope to engage millions of young people globally with creative programming and resources that will allow them to bring their creativity to the world. \nLuca Bosani, costume designer, Victoria & Albert Museum Resident.\n DonChristian Jones, multimedia artist, Museum of Modern Art Resident.\nJacqui Ramrayka, ceramicist, Victoria & Albert Museum Resident.\n Rachel Sale, illustrator, Victoria & Albert Museum Resident.\n9\n\u00a9 2024 Adobe.

Adobe Foundation x NAMI\nIn 2023, the Adobe Foundation and the National Alliance on \nMental Illness (NAMI) partnered to further explore the connection between mental health, well-being and creative expression. Together, the organizations surveyed nearly 2,000 people ages 13+ across the U.S. on how creativity impacts mental health. The findings, detailed in the published study \nCreative Approaches for  \nManaging Mental Health , found that engaging in any creative \nactivity has a strong, positive impact on metal health. For example, nearly two-thirds of survey participants (63%) identified an improved sense of confidence in their abilities as a benefit, while a similar number (61%) said that creative activities reduce their feelings of stress or anxiety.\nThese important findings have paved the way for more programs \nand collaborations that provide the necessary tools, resources and support to those who need it most during this critical time. \n63%\nof survey participants identified an improved sense of confidence in their abilities as a benefit of engaging in creative activity61%\nof survey participants said that creative activities reduce their feelings of stress or anxiety\n10\n\u00a9 2024 Adobe.

EAI is a holistic model of corporate philanthropy that draws upon the best of Adobe to support nonprofit organizations through foundation grants, employee  \ngiving and volunteering, access to Adobe products, and pro bono support.In 2023, we funded an additional $10 million through the Adobe \nFoundation across the EAI cohort of 11 international and U.S. nonprofits to continue to foster racial and social justice worldwide, bringing our overall investment to over $30 million. Each of the 11 organizations is aligned with the priorities of our DEI team and Employee Networks, which participated in the selection of the nonprofits.\nThrough our \u201ctrust-based philanthropy\u201d model, we provide \ngeneral operating support to empower EAI organizations to make critical investments in areas where they can best scale their work and make an impact \u2014 rather than dictate where grants should be allocated. This has equipped EAI nonprofits with stronger infrastructure to expand programming in education, workforce and community development around the world.\nAside from multiyear general operating grants from the Adobe \nFoundation, Adobe is further engaging with EAI organizations by providing access to our products, employee pro bono consulting and volunteering, and legislative and advocacy support. After two years of virtual meetings, in November 2023 leaders from Adobe and the 11 nonprofit organizations came together in person to map out opportunities for deeper collaboration and share best practices in corporate support for racial and social justice organizations.\nTogether with the Adobe Foundation, Adobe is making long-term, \nstrategic commitments and investments through EAI to provide meaningful partnership opportunities, learning experiences for employees, and new ways of leveraging Adobe\u2019s unique strengths in support of key issues to our company and communities.\n\u201cWith Adobe\u2019s support, we\u2019ve been able to grow \nour fundraising, develop more content that \nengages Asian and Pacific Islander communities, \nand drive further awareness.\u201d \n\u2014 Paul Ocampo, Director of Development, Asian Americans      \n    Advancing Justice \u2013 Asian Law Caucus\nWe are proud to work alongside these  11 ins\npirational organizations for the EAI.\n23\n\u00a9 2024 Adobe.

  "AI Ethics\nAdobe is committed to advancing provenance tools and solutions to bring more transparency and trust to the digital ecosystem. \nGenerative AI makes it easier than ever to create misleading and deceptive content in mere seconds. Especially with more than  40 elections happening around the world this year, it is critical to give people the information they need to understand where a piece  of digital content came from and what happened to it along the way, including whether AI was used in the editing or creation process. \nTrust: Content Authenticity  \nWe co-developed Content Credentials \u2014 which is like a digital \nnutrition label for content \u2014 showing information such as a creator\u2019s name, the date an image was created, any edits that were made, and whether AI was used. Adobe has incorporated Content Credentials into popular Adobe applications, like Photoshop, Lightroom and Firefly, and is working to advance Content Credentials as the industry standard for establishing content provenance.  Furthermore, Adobe advocated for the inclusion of provenance and AI labeling in policy and legislation such as in the White House Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI, and in the European Union\u2019s AI Act, and we recently joined leading technology companies in signing the \u201cTech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.\u201d Like so many far-reaching technological advances, we believe that AI will require collaboration across public and private sectors, innovation not just in technology but also in business practices, law and policy, along with a steadfast commitment to accountability, responsibility and transparency. \nCreating a trustworthy digital ecosystem requires ongoing \ncollaboration across the software industry and with policymakers. Established in 2019, Adobe leads the Content Authenticity  Initiative (CAI), a global, diverse, cross-industry coalition whose  goal is to combat misinformation and restore trust online  through provenance. CAI now counts more than 3,000 members from across industries \u2014 including Associated Press, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Nikon, Leica, Universal Music Group and Qualcomm \u2014 all united behind the adoption of Content Credentials. Content Credentials are built on an open standard developed by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), allowing anyone to implement them into their own tools and platforms to provide transparency and content provenance. \nAs part of the larger initiative, we set out to train and equip all our \nCommunity of Practice grantees, a cohort of nonprofit partners using Adobe technology to scale solutions to address specific and current societal issues globally, with CAI technology to increase transparency and trust online, while driving thought leadership in AI transparency. In 2023, as part of this initiative, we activated and educated a diverse and experienced community of documentary photographers, videographers, journalists and students in 100+ countries globally on Content Credentials in Photoshop and Lightroom. \n27\n\u00a9 2024 Adobe.

  "Products\nGen AI\nIn 2023, we launched Adobe Firefly, our family of creative gen AI \nmodels, which became one of the most successful beta launches in our history. We recognize that training and using gen AI products require a significant amount of energy and actively sought new ways to deliver this technology responsibly by investing in code optimization, minimizing redundant steps, avoiding unnecessary content generation, and implementing efficient scheduling and batching strategies. These developments are just the beginning of our journey to decrease the environmental footprint of gen AI, and we will continue to focus on energy efficiency and emissions reduction as an integral part of future AI innovations. \nImage generated using Adobe Firefly.Adobe Substance 3D \nAdobe\u2019s 3D design and immersive media innovations enable global brands like HUGO BOSS to advance their sustainability goals. For HUGO BOSS suppliers and vendors, teams can review designs digitally, bypassing the need to create and ship samples back and forth. And any changes that need to be made for colors, fabric and shapes can also be done online. 3D cuts down on content production as well, avoiding scenarios where teams must travel to different locations around the world to photograph new collections. Based on estimates from our Substance 3D  \nsustainability calculator , using 3D rendering can help customers \nreduce their carbon footprint by an average of 98% compared to traditional photoshoots while also saving time and money.   Building upon this work, in 2023 Adobe went further and estimated the potential environmental, time and cost savings between virtual prototyping in Substance 3D applications and physical prototyping for five consumer good products. Following the general life cycle assessment methodology, the results indicate that significant emissions reduction potential exists for all five products when using Substance 3D \u2014 achieving a GHG emissions reduction of 83% to 90% depending on the product. \nCustomer Spotlight: Mizuno \nMizuno, known for its quality sports equipment and sportwear, evolved its shoe design process by adding Adobe Substance 3D Collection to its 3D design workflow.

Although certain matters discussed in this report may be significant, any significance should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of materiality used for the purposes of complying with U.S. federal securities laws and regulations. \nThe information covered by this report contains \u201cforward-looking \nstatements\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our plans, initiatives, projections, goals, commitments and strategies, and related business and stakeholder impacts. Each of the forward-looking statements we make in this report involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions based on information available to us as of the date of this report. Such risks and uncertainties, many of which relate to matters beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: assumptions not being realized; global sociodemographic and economic trends; changing laws and regulations; evolving sustainability strategies; scientific or technological developments; climate-related conditi\nons and weather events; our ability to gather and verify \ndata regarding impacts; the compliance of third parties with our policies and procedures; our expansion into new products, services, technologies and geographic regions; and other changes in circumstances, as well as the factors set forth in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of Adobe\u2019s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The risks described in this report and in Adobe\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should be carefully reviewed.
